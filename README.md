# personal-portfolio

Hello, I'm building a living portfolio as my real first project
that includes the combinations of JS, HTML, and CSS.
It won't look to pretty at first, but it's a crucial stepping stone
in how I can solidify my ongoing knowledge of these languages.

Languages used: HTML, CSS, JS
Frameworks used: None
Language: English
